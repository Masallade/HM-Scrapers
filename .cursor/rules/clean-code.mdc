Clean Code Development Guidelines

While writing or updating the code, ensure that clean coding and industrial-level best practices are strictly followed.

Code Structure & Quality

The code should be clean, readable, maintainable, and scalable.

Follow industry-standard naming conventions for variables, functions, classes, and files.

Keep functions and modules small and focused on a single responsibility.

Avoid tightly coupled logic; ensure the code is easy to extend and refactor.

Functional & Modular Approach

Use a functional approach where applicable:

Each function should perform one clear task.

Functions should be reusable and testable.

Apply a modular architecture:

Break the logic into independent modules/files.

Each module should handle a specific concern or feature.

Modules should communicate through well-defined interfaces.

Commenting & Documentation

Add a paragraph-level comment at the top of each file explaining:

The purpose of the file

The problem it solves

Its role within the overall system

Add clear and meaningful comments throughout the code, explaining:

What each block or line of code does

The intention behind complex logic

Comments should be written in simple and professional language, making the code easy to understand for new and future developers.

General Best Practices

Treat the code as production-ready, not temporary or experimental.

Follow DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) and SOLID principles where applicable.

Ensure consistency in formatting, spacing, and structure.

The code should be self-explanatory, with comments enhancing clarity rather than compensating for poor structure.

Also comments on every single line for better understanding, and where you update the code or add the code please add a comment paragraph of the below code purpose.
